# Xeili-DiscordBot
Xeili is a VERY EARLY INCOMPLETE discord bot framework built on Python.

If you want to use this very early build, You will have to add your token in XeiliWP.py and your ID in fragments/compact.py
You will also want to make the fragment/cog/module code usable only to you too.

Current issues:
- No Checks for Owner
- Fragments/modules does not save inbetween reboots.
- Help menu does not show up.... sometimes.
