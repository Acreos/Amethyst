# Xeili-DiscordBot
Xeili is a VERY EARLY INCOMPLETE discord bot framework built on Python brought to you by **Destiny Productions**.

If you want to use this very early build, You will have to add your token in XeiliWP.py and your ID in fragments/compact.py then run XeiliWP.py
You will also want to make the fragment/cog/module code usable only to you too.

Current issues:
- No Checks for Owner
- Fragments/modules does not save inbetween reboots.
- Help menu does not show up.... sometimes.




Oh also if you're wondering, XeiliWP stands for Xeili Working Prototype.
